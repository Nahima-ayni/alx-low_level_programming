		SINGLY-LINKED LISTS
It consists of nodes, each containing a data field and a 'next' field that points to the next node in the sequence.
The list starts with a head node and ends with a node that has its 'next' field set to NULL, indicating the end of the list,Tail.
Operations include insertion (at the beginning, end, or a specific position), deletion (specific node or at a position), and traversal (accessing each node, typically to perform an operation like search or update).
It's a dynamic data structure, meaning it can grow and shrink at runtime.
It does not allow random access to the data; operations require sequential access from the head node.
It's efficient in terms of memory because it doesn't reserve more space than necessary, unlike arrays.
