Learning about even more pointers, arrays and strings.
Dealing with 2D and multidimensional arrays.
pointers to pointers.

0. memset: we will be getting the memory address of n and then store it in *s. We will then manipulate *s and assign it  to constant b.

1-memcpy.c: copy memory area from source to destination

2-strchr.c: locates a character in string to the first occurance of c.

3-strspn.c: calculates the length of prefix substring e.g when you want 		to search for a specic word this one can be used
