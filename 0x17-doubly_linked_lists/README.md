A doubly linked list is a data structure that consists of nodes where each node contains data and two pointers, one pointing to the next node in the sequence (next pointer) and another pointing to the previous node (prev pointer).

Key points about doubly linked lists:

1. **Nodes:**
   - Each node in a doubly linked list contains:
     - Data: The actual information stored in the node.
     - Next Pointer: Points to the next node in the sequence.
     - Prev Pointer: Points to the previous node in the sequence.

2. **Head and Tail:**
   - The doubly linked list has a head, which points to the first node, and a tail, which points to the last node.
   - The prev pointer of the head is null, and the next pointer of the tail is null.

3. **Traversal:**
   - Traversing a doubly linked list can be done in both directions (forward and backward) due to the presence of prev pointers.

4. **Insertion and Deletion:**
   - Insertion and deletion of nodes in a doubly linked list are more flexible compared to a singly linked list.
   - Insertion and deletion at the beginning, end, or in the middle of the list can be performed efficiently.

5. **Memory Overhead:**
   - Doubly linked lists have a higher memory overhead than singly linked lists due to the storage of both next and prev pointers.

6. **Advantages:**
   - Efficient for operations involving traversal in both directions.
   - Insertion and deletion at both ends are faster compared to a singly linked list.

7. **Disadvantages:**
   - Increased memory usage compared to singly linked lists.
   - Additional complexity in managing the prev pointers.

Doubly linked lists are commonly used in situations where frequent insertions and deletions are required, and traversing in both directions is beneficial.
