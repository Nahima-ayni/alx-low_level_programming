Structures in C:

- Definition**: A structure is a user-defined data type that groups together variables of different data types under a single name.

-Syntax:
  struct struct_name {
      data_type member1;
      data_type member2;
      // More members...
  };
  

-Usage:
  - Structures are used to group related data into a single unit.
  - They help manage complex data with multiple attributes.
  - Often used for passing data to functions and organizing data logically.

-Accessing Members**: Use the dot (`.`) operator to access structure members in C.

Typedef in C:

- Definition: `typedef` is used to create aliases or alternative names for existing data types, including structures, to improve code readability.

- Syntax:
  typedef existing_data_type new_data_type;


-Usage:
  - Simplifies complex data type declarations, such as those involving structures.
  - Enhances code readability by providing descriptive type names
